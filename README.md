👋 WELCOME TO CROWDAIR!👋

📈 Crowdair is a plateform design to let users trade their actions on specific events. 
💰 The goal is to make as much coins a possible to get the first position of the podium. 

Every event includes news to help you make the best choice before selling or buying actions.
Notice that events have an ending time 📅, so you need to hurry up. 

This project was created at the end of our batch(#732) at Le Wagon Lausane.
